<h2>THE SONG OF RAH&Eacute;RO<br />
<span class="GutSmall">A LEGEND OF TAHITI</span></h2>
<h3><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>TO ORI A
ORI</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Ori</span>, my brother in
the island mode,<br />
In every tongue and meaning much my friend,<br />
This story of your country and your clan,<br />
In your loved house, your too much honoured guest,<br />
I made in English.&nbsp; Take it, being done;<br />
And let me sign it with the name you gave.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Teriitera</span>.</p>
<h3><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>I. THE
SLAYING OF T&Aacute;MAT&Eacute;A</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">It</span> fell in the days
of old, as the men of Tai&aacute;rapu tell,<br />
A youth went forth to the fishing, and fortune favoured him
well.<br />
T&aacute;mat&eacute;a his name: gullible, simple, and kind,<br />
Comely of countenance, nimble of body, empty of mind,<br />
His mother ruled him and loved him beyond the wont of a wife,<br
/>
Serving the lad for eyes and living herself in his life.<br />
Alone from the sea and the fishing came T&aacute;mat&eacute;a the
fair,<br />
Urging his boat to the beach, and the mother awaited him
there,<br />
<a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>&mdash;&ldquo;Long may you live!&rdquo; said she.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Your fishing has sped to a wish.<br />
And now let us choose for the king the fairest of all your
fish.<br />
For fear inhabits the palace and grudging grows in the land,<br
/>
Marked is the sluggardly foot and marked the niggardly hand,<br
/>
The hours and the miles are counted, the tributes numbered and
weighed,<br />
And woe to him that comes short, and woe to him that
delayed!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">So spoke on the beach the mother, and
counselled the wiser thing.<br />
For Rah&eacute;ro stirred in the country and secretly mined the
king.<br />
Nor were the signals wanting of how the leaven wrought,<br />
In the cords of obedience loosed and the tributes grudgingly
brought.<br />
<a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>And when
last to the temple of Oro the boat with the victim sped,<br />
And the priest uncovered the basket and looked on the face of the
dead,<br />
Trembling fell upon all at sight of an ominous thing,<br />
For there was the aito <a name="citation5"></a><a
href="#footnote5" class="citation">[5]</a> dead, and he of the
house of the king.</p>
<p class="poetry">So spake on the beach the mother, matter worthy
of note,<br />
And wattled a basket well, and chose a fish from the boat;<br />
And T&aacute;mat&eacute;a the pliable shouldered the basket and
went,<br />
And travelled, and sang as he travelled, a lad that was well
content.<br />
Still the way of his going was round by the roaring coast,<br />
Where the ring of the reef is broke and the trades run riot the
most.<br />
On his left, with smoke as of battle, the billows battered the
land;<br />
<a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>Unscalable,
turreted mountains rose on the inner hand.<br />
And cape, and village, and river, and vale, and mountain
above,<br />
Each had a name in the land for men to remember and love;<br />
And never the name of a place, but lo! a song in its praise:<br
/>
Ancient and unforgotten, songs of the earlier days,<br />
That the elders taught to the young, and at night, in the full of
the moon,<br />
Garlanded boys and maidens sang together in tune.<br />
T&aacute;mat&eacute;a the placable went with a lingering foot;<br
/>
He sang as loud as a bird, he whistled hoarse as a flute;<br />
He broiled in the sun, he breathed in the grateful shadow of
trees,<br />
In the icy stream of the rivers he waded over the knees;<br />
And still in his empty mind crowded, a thousand-fold,<br />
The deeds of the strong and the songs of the cunning heroes of
old.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>And now was he come to a place Tai&aacute;rapu honoured
the most,<br />
Where a silent valley of woods debouched on the noisy coast,<br
/>
Spewing a level river.&nbsp; There was a haunt of Pai. <a
name="citation7"></a><a href="#footnote7"
class="citation">[7]</a><br />
There, in his potent youth, when his parents drove him to die,<br
/>
Honoura lived like a beast, lacking the lamp and the fire,<br />
Washed by the rains of the trade and clotting his hair in the
mire;<br />
And there, so mighty his hands, he bent the tree to his
foot&mdash;<br />
So keen the spur of his hunger, he plucked it naked of fruit.<br
/>
There, as she pondered the clouds for the shadow of coming
ills,<br />
Ahupu, the woman of song, walked on high on the hills.</p>
<p class="poetry">Of these was Rah&eacute;ro sprung, a man of a
godly race;<br />
And inherited cunning of spirit and beauty of body and face.<br
/>
<a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>Of yore in
his youth, as an aito, Rah&eacute;ro wandered the land,<br />
Delighting maids with his tongue, smiting men with his hand.<br
/>
Famous he was in his youth; but before the midst of his life<br
/>
Paused, and fashioned a song of farewell to glory and strife.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>House of mine</i> (<i>it
went</i>), <i>house upon the sea</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Belov&rsquo;d of all my fathers</i>, <i>more
belov&rsquo;d by me</i>!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Vale of the strong Honoura</i>, <i>deep ravine of
Pai</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Again in your woody summits I hear the trade-wind
cry</i>.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>House of mine</i>, <i>in
your walls</i>, <i>strong sounds the sea</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Of all sounds on earth</i>, <i>dearest sound to
me</i>.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>I have heard the applause of men</i>, <i>I have
heard it arise and die</i>:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Sweeter now in my house I hear the trade-wind
cry</i>.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>These were the words of his singing, other the thought of
his heart;<br />
For secret desire of glory vexed him, dwelling apart.<br />
Lazy and crafty he was, and loved to lie in the sun,<br />
And loved the cackle of talk and the true word uttered in fun;<br
/>
Lazy he was, his roof was ragged, his table was lean,<br />
And the fish swam safe in his sea, and he gathered the near and
the green.<br />
He sat in his house and laughed, but he loathed the king of the
land,<br />
And he uttered the grudging word under the covering hand.<br />
Treason spread from his door; and he looked for a day to come,<br
/>
A day of the crowding people, a day of the summoning drum,<br />
When the vote should be taken, the king be driven forth in
disgrace,<br />
And Rah&eacute;ro, the laughing and lazy, sit and rule in his
place,<br />
<a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>Here
T&aacute;mat&eacute;a came, and beheld the house on the brook;<br
/>
And Rah&eacute;ro was there by the way and covered an oven to
cook. <a name="citation10a"></a><a href="#footnote10a"
class="citation">[10a]</a><br />
Naked he was to the loins, but the tattoo covered the lack,<br />
And the sun and the shadow of palms dappled his muscular back.<br
/>
Swiftly he lifted his head at the fall of the coming feet,<br />
And the water sprang in his mouth with a sudden desire of
meat;<br />
For he marked the basket carried, covered from flies and the sun;
<a name="citation10b"></a><a href="#footnote10b"
class="citation">[10b]</a><br />
And Rah&eacute;ro buried his fire, but the meat in his house was
done.</p>
<p class="poetry">Forth he stepped; and took, and delayed the
boy, by the hand;<br />
And vaunted the joys of meat and the ancient ways of the land:<br
/>
&mdash;&ldquo;Our sires of old in Tai&aacute;rapu, they that
created the race,<br />
<a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>Ate ever
with eager hand, nor regarded season or place,<br />
Ate in the boat at the oar, on the way afoot; and at night<br />
Arose in the midst of dreams to rummage the house for a bite.<br
/>
It is good for the youth in his turn to follow the way of the
sire;<br />
And behold how fitting the time! for here do I cover my
fire.&rdquo;<br />
&mdash;&ldquo;I see the fire for the cooking but never the meat
to cook,&rdquo;<br />
Said T&aacute;mat&eacute;a.&mdash;&ldquo;Tut!&rdquo; said
Rah&eacute;ro.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here in the brook<br />
And there in the tumbling sea, the fishes are thick as flies,<br
/>
Hungry like healthy men, and like pigs for savour and size:<br />
Crayfish crowding the river, sea-fish thronging the
sea.&rdquo;<br />
&mdash;&ldquo;Well it may be,&rdquo; says the other, &ldquo;and
yet be nothing to me.<br />
Fain would I eat, but alas!&nbsp; I have needful matter in
hand,<br />
Since I carry my tribute of fish to the jealous king of the
land.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>Now at the word a light sprang in Rah&eacute;ro&rsquo;s
eyes.<br />
&ldquo;I will gain me a dinner,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;and
lend the king a surprise.&rdquo;<br />
And he took the lad by the arm, as they stood by the side of the
track,<br />
And smiled, and rallied, and flattered, and pushed him forward
and back.<br />
It was &ldquo;You that sing like a bird, I never have heard you
sing,&rdquo;<br />
And &ldquo;The lads when I was a lad were none so feared of a
king.<br />
And of what account is an hour, when the heart is empty of
guile?<br />
But come, and sit in the house and laugh with the women
awhile;<br />
And I will but drop my hook, and behold! the dinner
made.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">So T&aacute;mat&eacute;a the pliable hung up
his fish in the shade<br />
On a tree by the side of the way; and Rah&eacute;ro carried him
in,<br />
<a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>Smiling as
smiles the fowler when flutters the bird to the gin,<br />
And chose him a shining hook, <a name="citation13"></a><a
href="#footnote13" class="citation">[13]</a> and viewed it with
sedulous eye,<br />
And breathed and burnished it well on the brawn of his naked
thigh,<br />
And set a mat for the gull, and bade him be merry and bide,<br />
Like a man concerned for his guest, and the fishing, and nothing
beside.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now when Rah&eacute;ro was forth, he paused and
hearkened, and heard<br />
The gull jest in the house and the women laugh at his word;<br />
And stealthily crossed to the side of the way, to the shady
place<br />
Where the basket hung on a mango; and craft transfigured his
face.<br />
<a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>Deftly he
opened the basket, and took of the fat of the fish,<br />
The cut of kings and chieftains, enough for a goodly dish.<br />
This he wrapped in a leaf, set on the fire to cook<br />
And buried; and next the marred remains of the tribute he
took,<br />
And doubled and packed them well, and covered the basket close<br
/>
&mdash;&ldquo;There is a buffet, my king,&rdquo; quoth he,
&ldquo;and a nauseous dose!&rdquo;&mdash;<br />
And hung the basket again in the shade, in a cloud of flies<br />
&mdash;&ldquo;And there is a sauce to your dinner, king of the
crafty eyes!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Soon as the oven was open, the fish smelt
excellent good.<br />
In the shade, by the house of Rah&eacute;ro, down they sat to
their food,<br />
And cleared the leaves <a name="citation14"></a><a
href="#footnote14" class="citation">[14]</a> in silence, or
uttered a jest and laughed,<br />
<a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>And
raising the cocoanut bowls, buried their faces and quaffed.<br />
But chiefly in silence they ate; and soon as the meal was
done,<br />
Rah&eacute;ro feigned to remember and measured the hour by the
sun,<br />
And &ldquo;T&aacute;mat&eacute;a,&rdquo; quoth he, &ldquo;it is
time to be jogging, my lad.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">So T&aacute;mat&eacute;a arose, doing ever the
thing he was bade,<br />
And carelessly shouldered the basket, and kindly saluted his
host;<br />
And again the way of his going was round by the roaring coast.<br
/>
Long he went; and at length was aware of a pleasant green,<br />
And the stems and shadows of palms, and roofs of lodges
between<br />
There sate, in the door of his palace, the king on a kingly
seat,<br />
<a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>And aitos
stood armed around, and the yottowas <a name="citation16"></a><a
href="#footnote16" class="citation">[16]</a> sat at his feet.<br
/>
But fear was a worm in his heart: fear darted his eyes;<br />
And he probed men&rsquo;s faces for treasons and pondered their
speech for lies.<br />
To him came T&aacute;mat&eacute;a, the basket slung in his
hand,<br />
And paid him the due obeisance standing as vassals stand.<br />
In silence hearkened the king, and closed the eyes in his
face,<br />
Harbouring odious thoughts and the baseless fears of the base;<br
/>
In silence accepted the gift and sent the giver away.<br />
So T&aacute;mat&eacute;a departed, turning his back on the
day.</p>
<p class="poetry">And lo! as the king sat brooding, a rumour rose
in the crowd;<br />
The yottowas nudged and whispered, the commons murmured aloud;<br
/>
Tittering fell upon all at sight of the impudent thing,<br />
<a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>At the
sight of a gift unroyal flung in the face of a king.<br />
And the face of the king turned white and red with anger and
shame<br />
In their midst; and the heart in his body was water and then was
flame;<br />
Till of a sudden, turning, he gripped an aito hard,<br />
A youth that stood with his &oacute;mare, <a
name="citation17"></a><a href="#footnote17"
class="citation">[17]</a> one of the daily guard,<br />
And spat in his ear a command, and pointed and uttered a name,<br
/>
And hid in the shade of the house his impotent anger and
shame.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now T&aacute;mat&eacute;a the fool was far on
the homeward way,<br />
The rising night in his face, behind him the dying day.<br />
Rah&eacute;ro saw him go by, and the heart of Rah&eacute;ro was
glad,<br />
Devising shame to the king and nowise harm to the lad;<br />
And all that dwelt by the way saw and saluted him well,<br />
For he had the face of a friend and the news of the town to
tell;<br />
<a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>And
pleased with the notice of folk, and pleased that his journey was
done,<br />
T&aacute;mat&eacute;a drew homeward, turning his back to the
sun.</p>
<p class="poetry">And now was the hour of the bath in
Tai&aacute;rapu: far and near<br />
The lovely laughter of bathers rose and delighted his ear.<br />
Night massed in the valleys; the sun on the mountain coast<br />
Struck, end-long; and above the clouds embattled their host,<br
/>
And glowed and gloomed on the heights; and the heads of the palms
were gems,<br />
And far to the rising eve extended the shade of their stems;<br
/>
And the shadow of T&aacute;mat&eacute;a hovered already at
home.</p>
<p class="poetry">And sudden the sound of one coming and running
light as the foam<br />
Struck on his ear; and he turned, and lo! a man on his track,<br
/>
<a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>Girded and
armed with an &oacute;mare, following hard at his back.<br />
At a bound the man was upon him;&mdash;and, or ever a word was

THE VENGING OF T&Aacute;MAT&Eacute;A</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Thus</span> was
Rah&eacute;ro&rsquo;s treason; thus and no further it sped<br />
The king sat safe in his place and a kindly fool was dead.</p>
<p class="poetry">But the mother of T&aacute;mat&eacute;a arose
with death in her eyes.<br />
All night long, and the next, Tai&aacute;rapu rang with her
cries.<br />
As when a babe in the wood turns with a chill of doubt<br />
And perceives nor home, nor friends, for the trees have closed
her about,<br />
The mountain rings and her breast is torn with the voice of
despair:<br />
So the lion-like woman idly wearied the air<br />
For awhile, and pierced men&rsquo;s hearing in vain, and wounded
their hearts.<br />
<a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>But as
when the weather changes at sea, in dangerous parts,<br />
And sudden the hurricane wrack unrolls up the front of the
sky,<br />
At once the ship lies idle, the sails hang silent on high,<br />
The breath of the wind that blew is blown out like the flame of a
lamp,<br />
And the silent armies of death draw near with inaudible tramp:<br
/>
So sudden, the voice of her weeping ceased; in silence she
rose<br />
And passed from the house of her sorrow, a woman clothed with
repose,<br />
Carrying death in her breast and sharpening death with her
hand.</p>
<p class="poetry">Hither she went and thither in all the coasts
of the land.<br />
They tell that she feared not to slumber alone, in the dead of
night,<br />
In accursed places; beheld, unblenched, the ribbon of light <a
name="citation21"></a><a href="#footnote21"
class="citation">[21]</a><br />
<a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>Spin from
temple to temple; guided the perilous skiff,<br />
Abhorred not the paths of the mountain and trod the verge of the
cliff;<br />
From end to end of the island, thought not the distance long,<br
/>
But forth from king to king carried the tale of her wrong.<br />
To king after king, as they sat in the palace door, she came,<br
/>
Claiming kinship, declaiming verses, naming her name<br />
And the names of all of her fathers; and still, with a heart on
the rack,<br />
Jested to capture a hearing and laughed when they jested back:<br
/>
So would deceive them awhile, and change and return in a
breath,<br />
And on all the men of Vaiau imprecate instant death;<br />
And tempt her kings&mdash;for Vaiau was a rich and prosperous
land,<br />
And flatter&mdash;for who would attempt it but warriors mighty of
hand?<br />
<a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>And change
in a breath again and rise in a strain of song,<br />
Invoking the beaten drums, beholding the fall of the strong,<br
/>
Calling the fowls of the air to come and feast on the dead.<br />
And they held the chin in silence, and heard her, and shook the
head;<br />
For they knew the men of Tai&aacute;rapu famous in battle and
feast,<br />
Marvellous eaters and smiters: the men of Vaiau not least.</p>
<p class="poetry">To the land of the N&aacute;munu-&uacute;ra, <a
name="citation23a"></a><a href="#footnote23a"
class="citation">[23a]</a> to Paea, at length she came,<br />
To men who were foes to the Tevas and hated their race and
name.<br />
There was she well received, and spoke with Hiopa the king. <a
name="citation23b"></a><a href="#footnote23b"
class="citation">[23b]</a><br />
And Hiopa listened, and weighed, and wisely considered the
thing.<br />
&ldquo;Here in the back of the isle we dwell in a sheltered
place,&rdquo;<br />
<a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>Quoth he
to the woman, &ldquo;in quiet, a weak and peaceable race.<br />
But far in the teeth of the wind lofty Tai&aacute;rapu lies;<br
/>
Strong blows the wind of the trade on its seaward face, and
cries<br />
Aloud in the top of arduous mountains, and utters its song<br />
In green continuous forests.&nbsp; Strong is the wind, and
strong<br />
And fruitful and hardy the race, famous in battle and feast,<br
/>
Marvellous eaters and smiters: the men of Vaiau not least.<br />
Now hearken to me, my daughter, and hear a word of the wise:<br
/>
How a strength goes linked with a weakness, two by two, like the
eyes.<br />
They can wield the &oacute;mare well and cast the javelin far;<br
/>
Yet are they greedy and weak as the swine and the children
are.<br />
Plant we, then, here at Paea, a garden of excellent fruits;<br />
Plant we bananas and kava and taro, the king of roots;<br />
<a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>Let the
pigs in Paea be tapu <a name="citation25"></a><a
href="#footnote25" class="citation">[25]</a> and no man fish for
a year;<br />
And of all the meat in Tahiti gather we threefold here.<br />
So shall the fame of our plenty fill the island, and so,<br />
At last, on the tongue of rumour, go where we wish it to go.<br
/>
Then shall the pigs of Tai&aacute;rapu raise their snouts in the
air;<br />
But we sit quiet and wait, as the fowler sits by the snare,<br />
And tranquilly fold our hands, till the pigs come nosing the
food:<br />
But meanwhile build us a house of Trot&eacute;a, the stubborn
wood,<br />
Bind it with incombustible thongs, set a roof to the room,<br />
Too strong for the hands of a man to dissever or fire to
consume;<br />
And there, when the pigs come trotting, there shall the feast be
spread,<br />
There shall the eye of the morn enlighten the feasters dead.<br
/>
So be it done; for I have a heart that pities your state,<br />
And Nateva and N&aacute;munu-&uacute;ra are fire and water for
hate.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>All was done as he said, and the gardens prospered; and
now<br />
The fame of their plenty went out, and word of it came to
Vaiau.<br />
For the men of N&aacute;munu-&uacute;ra sailed, to the windward
far,<br />
Lay in the offing by south where the towns of the Tevas are,<br
/>
And cast overboard of their plenty; and lo! at the Tevas feet<br
/>
The surf on all of the beaches tumbled treasures of meat.<br />
In the salt of the sea, a harvest tossed with the refluent
foam;<br />
And the children gleaned it in playing, and ate and carried it
home;<br />
And the elders stared and debated, and wondered and passed the
jest,<br />
But whenever a guest came by eagerly questioned the guest;<br />
And little by little, from one to another, the word went
round:<br />
<a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>&ldquo;In
all the borders of Paea the victual rots on the ground,<br />
And swine are plenty as rats.&nbsp; And now, when they fare to
the sea,<br />
The men of the N&aacute;munu-&uacute;ra glean from under the
tree<br />
And load the canoe to the gunwale with all that is toothsome to
eat;<br />
And all day long on the sea the jaws are crushing the meat,<br />
The steersman eats at the helm, the rowers munch at the oar,<br
/>
And at length, when their bellies are full, overboard with the
store!&rdquo;<br />
Now was the word made true, and soon as the bait was bare,<br />
All the pigs of Tai&aacute;rapu raised their snouts in the
air.<br />
Songs were recited, and kinship was counted, and tales were
told<br />
How war had severed of late but peace had cemented of old<br />
<a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>The clans
of the island.&nbsp; &ldquo;To war,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;now
set we an end,<br />
And hie to the N&aacute;munu-&uacute;ra even as a friend to a
friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">So judged, and a day was named; and soon as the
morning broke,<br />
Canoes were thrust in the sea and the houses emptied of folk.<br
/>
Strong blew the wind of the south, the wind that gathers the
clan;<br />
Along all the line of the reef the clamorous surges ran;<br />
And the clouds were piled on the top of the island
mountain-high,<br />
A mountain throned on a mountain.&nbsp; The fleet of canoes swept
by<br />
In the midst, on the green lagoon, with a crew released from
care,<br />
Sailing an even water, breathing a summer air,<br />
Cheered by a cloudless sun; and ever to left and right,<br />
<a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>Bursting
surge on the reef, drenching storms on the height.<br />
So the folk of Vaiau sailed and were glad all day,<br />
Coasting the palm-tree cape and crossing the populous bay<br />
By all the towns of the Tevas; and still as they bowled along,<br
/>
Boat would answer to boat with jest and laughter and song,<br />
And the people of all the towns trooped to the sides of the
sea<br />
And gazed from under the hand or sprang aloft on the tree,<br />
Hailing and cheering.&nbsp; Time failed them for more to do;<br
/>
The holiday village careened to the wind, and was gone from
view<br />
Swift as a passing bird; and ever as onward it bore,<br />
Like the cry of the passing bird, bequeathed its song to the
shore&mdash;<br />
Desirable laughter of maids and the cry of delight of the
child.<br />
And the gazer, left behind, stared at the wake and smiled.<br />
<a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>By all the
towns of the Tevas they went, and P&aacute;para last,<br />
The home of the chief, the place of muster in war; and passed<br
/>
The march of the lands of the clan, to the lands of an alien
folk.<br />
And there, from the dusk of the shoreside palms, a column of
smoke<br />
Mounted and wavered and died in the gold of the setting sun,<br
/>
&ldquo;Paea!&rdquo; they cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is
Paea.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so was the voyage done.</p>
<p class="poetry">In the early fall of the night, Hiopa came to
the shore,<br />
And beheld and counted the comers, and lo, they were forty
score:<br />
The pelting feet of the babes that ran already and played,<br />
The clean-lipped smile of the boy, the slender breasts of the
maid,<br />
And mighty limbs of women, stalwart mothers of men.<br />
<a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>The sires
stood forth unabashed; but a little back from his ken<br />
Clustered the scarcely nubile, the lads and maids, in a ring,<br
/>
Fain of each other, afraid of themselves, aware of the king<br />
And aping behaviour, but clinging together with hands and
eyes,<br />
With looks that were kind like kisses, and laughter tender as
sighs.<br />
There, too, the grandsire stood, raising his silver crest,<br />
And the impotent hands of a suckling groped in his barren
breast.<br />
The childhood of love, the pair well married, the innocent
brood,<br />
The tale of the generations repeated and ever renewed&mdash;<br
/>
Hiopa beheld them together, all the ages of man,<br />
And a moment shook in his purpose.</p>
<p
class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But
these were the foes of his clan,<br />
And he trod upon pity, and came, and civilly greeted the king,<br
/>
<a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>And
gravely entreated Rah&eacute;ro; and for all that could fight or
sing,<br />
And claimed a name in the land, had fitting phrases of praise;<br
/>
But with all who were well-descended he spoke of the ancient
days.<br />
And &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis true,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that in Paea
the victual rots on the ground;<br />
But, friends, your number is many; and pigs must be hunted and
found,<br />
And the lads troop to the mountains to bring the f&eacute;is
down,<br />
And around the bowls of the kava cluster the maids of the
town.<br />
So, for to-night, sleep here; but king, common, and priest<br />
To-morrow, in order due, shall sit with me in the
feast.&rdquo;<br />
Sleepless the live-long night, Hiopa&rsquo;s followers toiled.<br
/>
The pigs screamed and were slaughtered; the spars of the
guest-house oiled,<br />
The leaves spread on the floor.&nbsp; In many a mountain glen<br
/>
<a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>The moon
drew shadows of trees on the naked bodies of men<br />
Plucking and bearing fruits; and in all the bounds of the town<br
/>
Red glowed the cocoanut fires, and were buried and trodden
down.<br />
Thus did seven of the yottowas toil with their tale of the
clan,<br />
But the eighth wrought with his lads, hid from the sight of
man.<br />
In the deeps of the woods they laboured, piling the fuel high<br
/>
In fagots, the load of a man, fuel seasoned and dry,<br />
Thirsty to seize upon fire and apt to blurt into flame.</p>
<p class="poetry">And now was the day of the feast.&nbsp; The
forests, as morning came,<br />
Tossed in the wind, and the peaks quaked in the blaze of the
day<br />
<a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>And the
cocoanuts showered on the ground, rebounding and rolling away:<br
/>
A glorious morn for a feast, a famous wind for a fire.<br />
To the hall of feasting Hiopa led them, mother and sire<br />
And maid and babe in a tale, the whole of the holiday throng.<br
/>
Smiling they came, garlanded green, not dreaming of wrong;<br />
And for every three, a pig, tenderly cooked in the ground,<br />
Waited, and f&eacute;i, the staff of life, heaped in a mound<br
/>
For each where he sat;&mdash;for each, bananas roasted and raw<br
/>
Piled with a bountiful hand, as for horses hay and straw<br />
Are stacked in a stable; and fish, the food of desire, <a
name="citation34"></a><a href="#footnote34"
class="citation">[34]</a><br />
And plentiful vessels of sauce, and breadfruit gilt in the
fire;&mdash;<br />
And kava was common as water.&nbsp; Feasts have there been ere
now,<br />
And many, but never a feast like that of the folk of Vaiau.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>All day long they ate with the resolute greed of
brutes,<br />
And turned from the pigs to the fish, and again from the fish to
the fruits,<br />
And emptied the vessels of sauce, and drank of the kava deep;<br
/>
Till the young lay stupid as stones, and the strongest nodded to
sleep.<br />
Sleep that was mighty as death and blind as a moonless night<br
/>
Tethered them hand and foot; and their souls were drowned, and
the light<br />
Was cloaked from their eyes.&nbsp; Senseless together, the old
and the young,<br />
The fighter deadly to smite and the prater cunning of tongue,<br
/>
The woman wedded and fruitful, inured to the pangs of birth,<br
/>
And the maid that knew not of kisses, blindly sprawled on the
earth.<br />
<a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>From the
hall Hiopa the king and his chiefs came stealthily forth.<br />
Already the sun hung low and enlightened the peaks of the
north;<br />
But the wind was stubborn to die and blew as it blows at morn,<br
/>
Showering the nuts in the dusk, and e&rsquo;en as a banner is
torn,<br />
High on the peaks of the island, shattered the mountain cloud.<br
/>
And now at once, at a signal, a silent, emulous crowd<br />
Set hands to the work of death, hurrying to and fro,<br />
Like ants, to furnish the fagots, building them broad and low,<br
/>
And piling them high and higher around the walls of the hall.<br
/>
Silence persisted within, for sleep lay heavy on all;<br />
But the mother of T&aacute;mat&eacute;a stood at Hiopa&rsquo;s
side,<br />
And shook for terror and joy like a girl that is a bride.<br />
<a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>Night fell
on the toilers, and first Hiopa the wise<br />
Made the round of the house, visiting all with his eyes;<br />
And all was piled to the eaves, and fuel blockaded the door;<br

And within, in the house beleaguered, slumbered the forty
score.<br />
Then was an aito dispatched and came with fire in his hand,<br />
And Hiopa took it.&mdash;&ldquo;Within,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is
the life of a land;<br />
And behold!&nbsp; I breathe on the coal, I breathe on the dales
of the east,<br />
And silence falls on forest and shore; the voice of the feast<br
/>
Is quenched, and the smoke of cooking; the rooftree decays and
falls<br />
On the empty lodge, and the winds subvert deserted
walls.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Therewithal, to the fuel, he laid the glowing
coal;<br />
And the redness ran in the mass and burrowed within like a
mole,<br />
<a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>And
copious smoke was conceived.&nbsp; But, as when a dam is to
burst,<br />
The water lips it and crosses in silver trickles at first,<br />
And then, of a sudden, whelms and bears it away forthright:<br />
So now, in a moment, the flame sprang and towered in the
night,<br />
And wrestled and roared in the wind, and high over house and
tree,<br />
Stood, like a streaming torch, enlightening land and sea.</p>
<p class="poetry">But the mother of T&aacute;mat&eacute;a threw
her arms abroad,<br />
&ldquo;Pyre of my son,&rdquo; she shouted, &ldquo;debited
vengeance of God,<br />
Late, late, I behold you, yet I behold you at last,<br />
And glory, beholding!&nbsp; For now are the days of my agony
past,<br />
The lust that famished my soul now eats and drinks its desire,<br

And they that encompassed my son shrivel alive in the fire.<br />

precious the vengeance that comes after lingering years!<br />
Ye quenched the voice of my singer?&mdash;hark, in your dying

&mdash;Behold, the whole of your race consumes, sinew and bone<br

And torturing flesh together: man, mother, and maid<br />
Heaped in a common shambles; and already, borne by the trade,<br

RAH&Eacute;RO</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Rah&eacute;ro</span> was
there in the hall asleep: beside him his wife,<br />
Comely, a mirthful woman, one that delighted in life;<br />
And a girl that was ripe for marriage, shy and sly as a mouse;<br
/>
And a boy, a climber of trees: all the hopes of his house.<br />
Unwary, with open hands, he slept in the midst of his folk,<br />
And dreamed that he heard a voice crying without, and awoke,<br
/>
Leaping blindly afoot like one from a dream that he fears.<br />
A hellish glow and clouds were about him;&mdash;it roared in his
ears<br />
Like the sound of the cataract fall that plunges sudden and
steep;<br />
<a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>And
Rah&eacute;ro swayed as he stood, and his reason was still
asleep.<br />
Now the flame struck hard on the house, wind-wielded, a
fracturing blow,<br />
And the end of the roof was burst and fell on the sleepers
below;<br />
And the lofty hall, and the feast, and the prostrate bodies of
folk,<br />
Shone red in his eyes a moment, and then were swallowed of
smoke.<br />
In the mind of Rah&eacute;ro clearness came; and he opened his
throat;<br />
And as when a squall comes sudden, the straining sail of a
boat<br />
Thunders aloud and bursts, so thundered the voice of the man.<br
/>
&mdash;&ldquo;The wind and the rain!&rdquo; he shouted, the
mustering word of the clan, <a name="citation41"></a><a
href="#footnote41" class="citation">[41]</a><br />
And &ldquo;up!&rdquo; and &ldquo;to arms men of
Vaiau!&rdquo;&nbsp; But silence replied,<br />
<a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>Or only
the voice of the gusts of the fire, and nothing beside.</p>
<p class="poetry">Rah&eacute;ro stooped and groped.&nbsp; He
handled his womankind,<br />
But the fumes of the fire and the kava had quenched the life of
their mind,<br />
And they lay like pillars prone; and his hand encountered the
boy,<br />
And there sprang in the gloom of his soul a sudden lightning of
joy.<br />
&ldquo;Him can I save!&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;if I were speedy
enough.&rdquo;<br />
And he loosened the cloth from his loins, and swaddled the child
in the stuff;<br />
And about the strength of his neck he knotted the burden
well.</p>
<p class="poetry">There where the roof had fallen, it roared like
the mouth of hell.<br />
Thither Rah&eacute;ro went, stumbling on senseless folk,<br />
<a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>And
grappled a post of the house, and began to climb in the smoke:<br
/>
The last alive of Vaiau; and the son borne by the sire.<br />
The post glowed in the grain with ulcers of eating fire,<br />
And the fire bit to the blood and mangled his hands and
thighs;<br />
And the fumes sang in his head like wine and stung in his
eyes;<br />
And still he climbed, and came to the top, the place of proof,<br
/>
And thrust a hand through the flame, and clambered alive on the
roof.<br />
But even as he did so, the wind, in a garment of flames and
pain,<br />
Wrapped him from head to heel; and the waistcloth parted in
twain;<br />
And the living fruit of his loins dropped in the fire below.</p>
<p class="poetry">About the blazing feast-house clustered the
eyes of the foe,<br />
Watching, hand upon weapon, lest ever a soul should flee,<br />
<a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>Shading
the brow from the glare, straining the neck to see<br />
Only, to leeward, the flames in the wind swept far and wide,<br

And the forest sputtered on fire; and there might no man
abide.<br />
Thither Rah&eacute;ro crept, and dropped from the burning
eaves,<br />
And crouching low to the ground, in a treble covert of leaves<br
/>
And fire and volleying smoke, ran for the life of his soul<br />
Unseen; and behind him under a furnace of ardent coal,<br />
Cairned with a wonder of flame, and blotting the night with
smoke,<br />
Blazed and were smelted together the bones of all his folk.</p>
<p class="poetry">He fled unguided at first; but hearing the
breakers roar,<br />
Thitherward shaped his way, and came at length to the shore.<br
/>
Sound-limbed he was: dry-eyed; but smarted in every part;<br />
<a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>And the
mighty cage of his ribs heaved on his straining heart<br />
With sorrow and rage.&nbsp; And &ldquo;Fools!&rdquo; he cried,
&ldquo;fools of Vaiau,<br />

now?<br />
Those that I played with, those that nursed me, those that I
nursed?<br />
God, and I outliving them!&nbsp; I, the least and the
worst&mdash;<br />
I, that thought myself crafty, snared by this herd of swine,<br

In the tortures of hell and desolate, stripped of all that was
mine:<br />
All!&mdash;my friends and my fathers&mdash;the silver heads of
yore<br />
That trooped to the council, the children that ran to the open
door<br />
Crying with innocent voices and clasping a father&rsquo;s

And mine, my wife&mdash;my daughter&mdash;my sturdy climber of
trees<br />
Ah, never to climb again!&rdquo;</p>
<p

name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>Thus in the
dusk of the night,<br />
(For clouds rolled in the sky and the moon was swallowed from
sight,)<br />
Pacing and gnawing his fists, Rah&eacute;ro raged by the
shore.<br />
Vengeance: that must be his.&nbsp; But much was to do before;<br
/>
And first a single life to be snatched from a deadly place,<br />
A life, the root of revenge, surviving plant of the race:<br />
And next the race to be raised anew, and the lands of the clan<br
/>
Repeopled.&nbsp; So Rah&eacute;ro designed, a prudent man<br />
Even in wrath, and turned for the means of revenge and escape:<br
/>
A boat to be seized by stealth, a wife to be taken by rape.</p>
<p class="poetry">Still was the dark lagoon; beyond on the coral
wall,<br />
He saw the breakers shine, he heard them bellow and fall.<br />
Alone, on the top of the reef, a man with a flaming brand<br />
Walked, gazing and pausing, a fish-spear poised in his hand.<br
/>
<a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>The foam
boiled to his calf when the mightier breakers came,<br />
And the torch shed in the wind scattering tufts of flame.<br />
Afar on the dark lagoon a canoe lay idly at wait:<br />
A figure dimly guiding it: surely the fisherman&rsquo;s mate.<br
/>
Rah&eacute;ro saw and he smiled.&nbsp; He straightened his mighty
thews:<br />
Naked, with never a weapon, and covered with scorch and
bruise,<br />
He straightened his arms, he filled the void of his body with
breath,<br />
And, strong as the wind in his manhood, doomed the fisher to
death.</p>
<p class="poetry">Silent he entered the water, and silently swam,
and came<br />
There where the fisher walked, holding on high the flame.<br />
Loud on the pier of the reef volleyed the breach of the sea;<br
/>
And hard at the back of the man, Rah&eacute;ro crept to his
knee<br />
<a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>On the
coral, and suddenly sprang and seized him, the elder hand<br />
Clutching the joint of his throat, the other snatching the
brand<br />
Ere it had time to fall, and holding it steady and high.<br />
Strong was the fisher, brave, and swift of mind and of
eye&mdash;<br />
Strongly he threw in the clutch; but Rah&eacute;ro resisted the
strain,<br />
And jerked, and the spine of life snapped with a crack in
twain,<br />
And the man came slack in his hands and tumbled a lump at his
feet.</p>
<p class="poetry">One moment: and there, on the reef, where the
breakers whitened and beat,<br />
Rah&eacute;ro was standing alone, glowing and scorched and
bare,<br />
A victor unknown of any, raising the torch in the air.<br />
But once he drank of his breath, and instantly set him to fish<br
/>
<a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>Like a man
intent upon supper at home and a savoury dish.<br />
For what should the woman have seen?&nbsp; A man with a
torch&mdash;and then<br />
A moment&rsquo;s blur of the eyes&mdash;and a man with a torch
again.<br />
And the torch had scarcely been shaken.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah,
surely,&rdquo; Rah&eacute;ro said,<br />
&ldquo;She will deem it a trick of the eyes, a fancy born in the
head;<br />
But time must be given the fool to nourish a fool&rsquo;s
belief.&rdquo;<br />
So for a while, a sedulous fisher, he walked the reef,<br />
Pausing at times and gazing, striking at times with the spear:<br
/>
&mdash;Lastly, uttered the call; and even as the boat drew
near,<br />
Like a man that was done with its use, tossed the torch in the
sea.</p>
<p class="poetry">Lightly he leaped on the boat beside the woman;
and she<br />
Lightly addressed him, and yielded the paddle and place to
sit;<br />
<a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>For now
the torch was extinguished the night was black as the pit<br />
Rah&eacute;ro set him to row, never a word he spoke,<br />
And the boat sang in the water urged by his vigorous stroke.<br
/>
&mdash;&ldquo;What ails you?&rdquo; the woman asked, &ldquo;and
why did you drop the brand?<br />
We have only to kindle another as soon as we come to
land.&rdquo;<br />
Never a word Rah&eacute;ro replied, but urged the canoe.<br />
And a chill fell on the woman.&mdash;&ldquo;Atta! speak! is it
you?<br />
Speak!&nbsp; Why are you silent?&nbsp; Why do you bend aside?<br
/>
Wherefore steer to the seaward?&rdquo; thus she panted and
cried.<br />
Never a word from the oarsman, toiling there in the dark;<br />
But right for a gate of the reef he silently headed the bark,<br
/>
And wielding the single paddle with passionate sweep on sweep,<br
/>
Drove her, the little fitted, forth on the open deep.<br />
<a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>And fear,
there where she sat, froze the woman to stone:<br />
Not fear of the crazy boat and the weltering deep alone;<br />
But a keener fear of the night, the dark, and the ghostly
hour,<br />
And the thing that drove the canoe with more than a
mortal&rsquo;s power<br />
And more than a mortal&rsquo;s boldness.&nbsp; For much she knew
of the dead<br />
That haunt and fish upon reefs, toiling, like men, for bread,<br
/>
And traffic with human fishers, or slay them and take their
ware,<br />
Till the hour when the star of the dead <a
name="citation51a"></a><a href="#footnote51a"
class="citation">[51a]</a> goes down, and the morning air<br />
Blows, and the cocks are singing on shore.&nbsp; And surely she
knew<br />
The speechless thing at her side belonged to the grave. <a

All night from the south; all night, Rah&eacute;ro contended and
kept<br />
The prow to the cresting sea; and, silent as though she slept,<br
/>
The woman huddled and quaked.&nbsp; And now was the peep of
day.<br />
High and long on their left the mountainous island lay;<br />
And over the peaks of Tai&aacute;rapu arrows of sunlight
struck.<br />
On shore the birds were beginning to sing: the ghostly ruck<br />
Of the buried had long ago returned to the covered grave;<br />
And here on the sea, the woman, waxing suddenly brave,<br />
Turned her swiftly about and looked in the face of the man.<br />
And sure he was none that she knew, none of her country or
clan:<br />
<a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>A
stranger, mother-naked, and marred with the marks of fire,<br />
But comely and great of stature, a man to obey and admire.</p>
<p class="poetry">And Rah&eacute;ro regarded her also, fixed,
with a frowning face,<br />
Judging the woman&rsquo;s fitness to mother a warlike race.<br />
Broad of shoulder, ample of girdle, long in the thigh,<br />
Deep of bosom she was, and bravely supported his eye.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Woman,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;last night
the men of your folk&mdash;<br />
Man, woman, and maid, smothered my race in smoke.<br />
It was done like cowards; and I, a mighty man of my hands,<br />
Escaped, a single life; and now to the empty lands<br />
And smokeless hearths of my people, sail, with yourself,
alone.<br />
Before your mother was born, the die of to-day was thrown<br />
And you selected:&mdash;your husband, vainly striving, to fall<br
/>
<a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>Broken
between these hands:&mdash;yourself to be severed from all,<br />
The places, the people, you love&mdash;home, kindred, and

<h3><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>NOTES
TO THE SONG OF RAH&Eacute;RO</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Introduction</span>.&mdash;This tale, of
which I have not consciously changed a single feature, I received
from tradition.&nbsp; It is highly popular through all the
country of the eight Tevas, the clan to which Rah&eacute;ro
belonged; and particularly in Tai&aacute;rapu, the windward
peninsula of Tahiti, where he lived.&nbsp; I have heard from end
to end two versions; and as many as five different persons have
helped me with details.&nbsp; There seems no reason why the tale
should not be true.</p>
<p><a name="footnote5"></a><a href="#citation5"
class="footnote">[5]</a>&nbsp; Note 1, page 5.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>The aito</i>,&rdquo; <i>quasi</i> champion, or
brave.&nbsp; One skilled in the use of some weapon, who wandered
the country challenging distinguished rivals and taking part in
local quarrels.&nbsp; It was in the natural course of his
advancement to be at last employed by a chief, or king; and it
would then be a part of his duties to purvey the victim for
sacrifice.&nbsp; One of the doomed families was indicated; the
aito took his weapon and went forth alone; a little behind him
bearers followed with the sacrificial basket.&nbsp; Sometimes the
victim showed fight, sometimes prevailed; more often, without
doubt, he fell.&nbsp; But whatever body was found, the bearers
indifferently took up.</p>
<p><a name="footnote7"></a><a href="#citation7"
class="footnote">[7]</a>&nbsp; Note 2, page 7.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>Pai</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>Honoura</i>,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;<i>Ahupu</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Legendary <a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>persons of
Tahiti, all natives of Tai&aacute;rapu.&nbsp; Of the first two, I
have collected singular although imperfect legends, which I hope
soon to lay before the public in another place.&nbsp; Of Ahupu,
except in snatches of song, little memory appears to
linger.&nbsp; She dwelt at least about Tepari,&mdash;&ldquo;the
sea-cliffs,&rdquo;&mdash;the eastern fastness of the isle; walked
by paths known only to herself upon the mountains; was courted by
dangerous suitors who came swimming from adjacent islands, and
defended and rescued (as I gather) by the loyalty of native
fish.&nbsp; My anxiety to learn more of &ldquo;Ahupu
Vehine&rdquo; became (during my stay in Tai&aacute;rapu) a cause
of some diversion to that mirthful people, the inhabitants.</p>

&ldquo;<i>Covered an oven</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The cooking fire is
made in a hole in the ground, and is then buried.</p>
<p><a name="footnote10b"></a><a href="#citation10b"
class="footnote">[10b]</a>&nbsp; Note 4, page 10.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>Flies</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is perhaps an
anachronism.&nbsp; Even speaking of to-day in Tahiti, the phrase
would have to be understood as referring mainly to mosquitoes,
and these only in watered valleys with close woods, such as I
suppose to form the surroundings of Rah&eacute;ro&rsquo;s
homestead.&nbsp; Quarter of a mile away, where the air moves
freely, you shall look in vain for one.</p>

&ldquo;<i>Hook</i>&rdquo; of mother-of-pearl.&nbsp; Bright-hook
fishing, and that with the spear, appear to be the favourite
native methods.</p>

&ldquo;<i>Yottowas</i>,&rdquo; so spelt for convenience of
pronunciation, <i>quasi</i> Tacksmen in the Scottish
Highlands.&nbsp; The organisation of eight subdistricts and eight
yottowas to a division, which was <a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>in use (until yesterday) among the
Tevas, I have attributed without authority to the next clan: see
page 33.</p>
<p><a name="footnote17"></a><a href="#citation17"
class="footnote">[17]</a>&nbsp; Note 8, page 17.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>Omare</i>,&rdquo; pronounce as a dactyl.&nbsp; A loaded
quarter-staff, one of the two favourite weapons of the Tahitian
brave; the javelin, or casting spear, was the other.</p>
<p><a name="footnote21"></a><a href="#citation21"

&ldquo;<i>The ribbon of light</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Still to be seen
(and heard) spinning from one marae to another on Tahiti; or so I
have it upon evidence that would rejoice the Psychical
Society.</p>
<p><a name="footnote23a"></a><a href="#citation23a"
class="footnote">[23a]</a>&nbsp; Note 10, page 23.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>N&aacute;munu-&uacute;ra</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The complete
name is Namunu-ura te aropa.&nbsp; Why it should be pronounced
N&aacute;munu, dactyllically, I cannot see, but so I have always
heard it.&nbsp; This was the clan immediately beyond the Tevas on
the south coast of the island.&nbsp; At the date of the tale the
clan organisation must have been very weak.&nbsp; There is no
particular mention of T&aacute;mat&eacute;a&rsquo;s mother going
to Papara, to the head chief of her own clan, which would appear
her natural recourse.&nbsp; On the other hand, she seems to have
visited various lesser chiefs among the Tevas, and these to have
excused themselves solely on the danger of the enterprise.&nbsp;
The broad distinction here drawn between Nateva and
N&aacute;munu-&uacute;ra is therefore not impossibly
anachronistic.</p>

class="footnote">[23b]</a>&nbsp; Note 11, page 23.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>Hiopa the king</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hiopa was really the
name of the king (chief) of Vaiau; but I could never learn that
of the king of Paea&mdash;pronounce to rhyme with the Indian
<i>ayah</i>&mdash;and I gave the name where it was most
needed.&nbsp; This note must appear otiose indeed to readers who
have never heard of either of these two gentlemen; and perhaps
there is only one person in the world capable at once of reading
my verses and spying the inaccuracy.&nbsp; For him, for <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>Mr. Tati
Salmon, hereditary high chief of the Tevas, the note is solely
written: a small attention from a clansman to his chief.</p>
<p><a name="footnote25"></a><a href="#citation25"
class="footnote">[25]</a>&nbsp; Note 12, page 25.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>Let the pigs be tapu</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is impossible
to explain <i>tapu</i> in a note; we have it as an English word,
taboo.&nbsp; Suffice it, that a thing which was <i>tapu</i> must
not be touched, nor a place that was <i>tapu</i> visited.</p>
<p><a name="footnote34"></a><a href="#citation34"
class="footnote">[34]</a>&nbsp; Note 13, page 34.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>Fish</i>, <i>the food of desire</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; There
is a special word in the Tahitian language to signify
<i>hungering after fish</i>.&nbsp; I may remark that here is one
of my chief difficulties about the whole story.&nbsp; How did
king, commons, women, and all come to eat together at this
feast?&nbsp; But it troubled none of my numerous authorities; so
there must certainly be some natural explanation.</p>

&ldquo;<i>The star of the dead</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Venus as a
morning star.&nbsp; I have collected much curious evidence as to
this belief.&nbsp; The dead retain their taste for a fish diet,
enter into copartnery with living fishers, and haunt the reef and
the lagoon.&nbsp; The conclusion attributed to the nameless lady
of the legend would be reached to-day, under the like
circumstances, by ninety per cent of Polynesians: and here I
probably understate by one-tenth.</p>

the tribe was neither fish nor fruit,<br />
And the deepest pit of popoi stood empty to the foot. <a

The clans upon the left and the clans upon the right<br />
Now oiled their carven maces and scoured their daggers bright;<br
/>
They gat them to the thicket, to the deepest of the shade,<br />
And lay with sleepless eyes in the deadly ambuscade.<br />
And oft in the starry even the song of morning rose,<br />
What time the oven smoked in the country of their foes;<br />
For oft to loving hearts, and waiting ears and sight,<br />
The lads that went to forage returned not with the night.<br />
Now first the children sickened, and then the women paled,<br />
<a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>And the
great arms of the warrior no more for war availed.<br />
Hushed was the deep drum, discarded was the dance;<br />
And those that met the priest now glanced at him askance.<br />
The priest was a man of years, his eyes were ruby-red, <a
name="citation62a"></a><a href="#footnote62a"
class="citation">[62a]</a><br />
He neither feared the dark nor the terrors of the dead,<br />
He knew the songs of races, the names of ancient date;<br />
And the beard upon his bosom would have bought the chief&rsquo;s
estate.<br />
He dwelt in a high-built lodge, hard by the roaring shore,<br />
Raised on a noble terrace and with tikis <a
name="citation62b"></a><a href="#footnote62b"
class="citation">[62b]</a> at the door.<br />
Within it was full of riches, for he served his nation well,<br
/>
And full of the sound of breakers, like the hollow of a shell.<br
/>
For weeks he let them perish, gave never a helping sign,<br />
But sat on his oiled platform to commune with the divine,<br />
But sat on his high terrace, with the tikis by his side,<br />
And stared on the blue ocean, like a parrot, ruby-eyed.<br />
<a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>Dawn as
yellow as sulphur leaped on the mountain height:<br />
Out on the round of the sea the gems of the morning light,<br />
Up from the round of the sea the streamers of the sun;&mdash;<br

But down in the depths of the valley the day was not begun.<br />
In the blue of the woody twilight burned red the cocoa-husk,<br
/>
And the women and men of the clan went forth to bathe in the
dusk,<br />
A word that began to go round, a word, a whisper, a start:<br />
Hope that leaped in the bosom, fear that knocked on the heart:<br
/>
&ldquo;See, the priest is not risen&mdash;look, for his door is
fast!<br />
He is going to name the victims; he is going to help us at
last.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Thrice rose the sun to noon; and ever, like one
of the dead,<br />
<a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>The priest
lay still in his house with the roar of the sea in his head;<br
/>
There was never a foot on the floor, there was never a whisper of
speech;<br />
Only the leering tikis stared on the blinding beach.<br />
Again were the mountains fired, again the morning broke;<br />
And all the houses lay still, but the house of the priest
awoke.<br />
Close in their covering roofs lay and trembled the clan,<br />
But the ag&egrave;d, red-eyed priest ran forth like a lunatic
man;<br />
And the village panted to see him in the jewels of death
again,<br />
In the silver beards of the old and the hair of women slain.<br
/>
Frenzy shook in his limbs, frenzy shone in his eyes,<br />
And still and again as he ran, the valley rang with his cries.<br
/>
All day long in the land, by cliff and thicket and den,<br />
He ran his lunatic rounds, and howled for the flesh of men;<br />
<a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>All day
long he ate not, nor ever drank of the brook;<br />
And all day long in their houses the people listened and
shook&mdash;<br />
All day long in their houses they listened with bated breath,<br

And never a soul went forth, for the sight of the priest was
death.</p>
<p class="poetry">Three were the days of his running, as the gods
appointed of yore,<br />
Two the nights of his sleeping alone in the place of gore:<br />
The drunken slumber of frenzy twice he drank to the lees,<br />
On the sacred stones of the High-place under the sacred trees;<br
/>
With a lamp at his ashen head he lay in the place of the
feast,<br />
And the sacred leaves of the banyan rustled around the priest.<br

Last, when the stated even fell upon terrace and tree,<br />
<a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>And the
shade of the lofty island lay leagues away to sea,<br />
And all the valleys of verdure were heavy with manna and musk,<br

The wreck of the red-eyed priest came gasping home in the
dusk.<br />
He reeled across the village, he staggered along the shore,<br />
And between the leering tikis crept groping through his door.</p>
<p class="poetry">There went a stir through the lodges, the voice
of speech awoke;<br />
Once more from the builded platforms arose the evening smoke.<br
/>
And those who were mighty in war, and those renowned for an
art<br />
Sat in their stated seats and talked of the morrow apart.</p>

In the lighted house of her father, why should Taheia start?<br

Taheia heavy of hair, Taheia tender of heart,<br />
Taheia the well-descended, a bountiful dealer in love,<br />
Nimble of foot like the deer, and kind of eye like the dove?<br

Sly and shy as a cat, with never a change of face,<br />
Taheia slips to the door, like one that would breathe a space;<br

Saunters and pauses, and looks at the stars, and lists to the
seas;<br />
<a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>Then

Ever nearer and nearer the note of the one-stringed harp;<br />

<a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>For him
the oven smoke as for a speechless beast,<br />
And the sire of my Taheia come greedy to the feast.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Rua, be silent, spare me.&nbsp; Taheia closes her ears.<br
/>
Pity my yearning heart, pity my girlish years!<br />
Flee from the cruel hands, flee from the knife and coal,<br />
Lie hid in the deeps of the woods, Rua, sire of my
soul!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Whither to flee, Taheia, whither in all
of the land?<br />
The fires of the bloody kitchen are kindled on every hand;<br />
On every hand in the isle a hungry whetting of teeth,<br />
Eyes in the trees above, arms in the brush beneath.<br />
Patience to lie in wait, cunning to follow the sleuth,<br />
Abroad the foes I have fought, and at home the friends of my
youth.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Love, love, beloved Rua, love has a
clearer eye,<br />
Hence from the arms of love you go not forth to die.<br />
There, where the broken mountain drops sheer into the glen,<br />
<a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>There
shall you find a hold from the boldest hunter of men;<br />
There, in the deep recess, where the sun falls only at noon,<br
/>
And only once in the night enters the light of the moon,<br />
Nor ever a sound but of birds, or the rain when it falls with a
shout;<br />
For death and the fear of death beleaguer the valley about.<br />
Tapu it is, but the gods will surely pardon despair;<br />
Tapu, but what of that?&nbsp; If Rua can only dare.<br />
Tapu and tapu and tapu, I know they are every one right;<br />
But the god of every tapu is not always quick to smite.<br />
Lie secret there, my Rua, in the arms of awful gods,<br />
Sleep in the shade of the trees on the couch of the kindly
sods,<br />
Sleep and dream of Taheia, Taheia will wake for you;<br />
And whenever the land wind blows and the woods are heavy with
dew,<br />
Alone through the horror of night, <a name="citation72"></a><a
href="#footnote72" class="citation">[72]</a> with food for the
soul of her love,<br />
Taheia the undissuaded will hurry true as the dove.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>&ldquo;Taheia, the pit of the night crawls with
treacherous things,<br />
Spirits of ultimate air and the evil souls of things;<br />
The souls of the dead, the stranglers, that perch in the trees of
the wood,<br />
Waiters for all things human, haters of evil and good.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Rua, behold me, kiss me, look in my eyes

Are these the eyes of a maid that would leave her lover in
need?<br />
Brave in the eye of day, my father ruled in the fight;<br />
The child of his loins, Taheia, will play the man in the
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">So it was spoken, and so agreed, and Taheia
arose<br />
And smiled in the stars and was gone, swift as the swallow
goes;<br />
And Rua stood on the hill, and sighed, and followed her
flight,<br />
And there were the lodges below, each with its door alight;<br />
<a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>From folk
that sat on the terrace and drew out the even long<br />
Sudden crowings of laughter, monotonous drone of song;<br />
The quiet passage of souls over his head in the trees; <a

And from all around the haven the crumbling thunder of seas.<br

&ldquo;Farewell, my home,&rdquo; said Rua.&nbsp; &ldquo;Farewell,

beat.&rdquo;</p>

THE FEAST</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Dawn</span> as yellow as
sulphur leaped on the naked peak,<br />
And all the village was stirring, for now was the priest to
speak.<br />
Forth on his terrace he came, and sat with the chief in talk;<br
/>
His lips were blackened with fever, his cheeks were whiter than
chalk;<br />
Fever clutched at his hands, fever nodded his head,<br />
But, quiet and steady and cruel, his eyes shone ruby-red.<br />
In the earliest rays of the sun the chief rose up content;<br />
Braves were summoned, and drummers; messengers came and went;<br
/>
Braves ran to their lodges, weapons were snatched from the
wall;<br />
<a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>The
commons herded together, and fear was over them all.<br />
Festival dresses they wore, but the tongue was dry in their
mouth,<br />
And the blinking eyes in their faces skirted from north to
south.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now to the sacred enclosure gathered the
greatest and least,<br />
And from under the shade of the banyan arose the voice of the
feast,<br />
The frenzied roll of the drum, and a swift, monotonous song.<br
/>
Higher the sun swam up; the trade wind level and strong<br />
Awoke in the tops of the palms and rattled the fans aloud,<br />
And over the garlanded heads and shining robes of the crowd<br />
Tossed the spiders of shadow, scattered the jewels of sun.<br />
Forty the tale of the drums, and the forty throbbed like one;<br
/>
A thousand hearts in the crowd, and the even chorus of song,<br
/>
<a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>Swift as
the feet of a runner, trampled a thousand strong.<br />
And the old men leered at the ovens and licked their lips for the
food;<br />
And the women stared at the lads, and laughed and looked to the
wood.<br />
As when the sweltering baker, at night, when the city is dead,<br
/>
Alone in the trough of labour treads and fashions the bread;<br
/>
So in the heat, and the reek, and the touch of woman and man,<br
/>
The naked spirit of evil kneaded the hearts of the clan.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now cold was at many a heart, and shaking in
many a seat;<br />
For there were the empty baskets, but who was to furnish the
meat?<br />
For here was the nation assembled, and there were the ovens
anigh,<br />
And out of a thousand singers nine were numbered to die.<br />
Till, of a sudden, a shock, a mace in the air, a yell,<br />
<a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>And,
struck in the edge of the crowd, the first of the victims fell.
<a name="citation78"></a><a href="#footnote78"
class="citation">[78]</a><br />
Terror and horrible glee divided the shrinking clan,<br />
Terror of what was to follow, glee for a diet of man.<br />
Frenzy hurried the chaunt, frenzy rattled the drums;<br />
The nobles, high on the terrace, greedily mouthed their
thumbs;<br />
And once and again and again, in the ignorant crowd below,<br />
Once and again and again descended the murderous blow.<br />
Now smoked the oven, and now, with the cutting lip of a shell,<br
/>
A butcher of ninety winters jointed the bodies well.<br />
Unto the carven lodge, silent, in order due,<br />
The grandees of the nation one after one withdrew;<br />
And a line of laden bearers brought to the terrace foot,<br />
On poles across their shoulders, the last reserve of fruit.<br />
The victims bled for the nobles in the old appointed way;<br />
The fruit was spread for the commons, for all should eat
to-day.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>And now was the kava brewed, and now the cocoa ran,<br
/>
Now was the hour of the dance for child and woman and man;<br />
And mirth was in every heart, and a garland on every head,<br />
And all was well with the living and well with the eight who were
dead.<br />
Only the chiefs and the priest talked and consulted awhile:<br />
&ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; they said, and &ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo;
and nodded and seemed to smile:<br />
&ldquo;Rua the child of dirt, the creature of common clay,<br />
Rua must die to-morrow, since Rua is gone to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Out of the groves of the valley, where clear
the blackbirds sang.<br />
Sheer from the trees of the valley the face of the mountain
sprang;<br />
Sheer and bare it rose, unscalable barricade,<br />
Beaten and blown against by the generous draught of the trade.<br
/>
<a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>Dawn on
its fluted brow painted rainbow light,<br />
Close on its pinnacled crown trembled the stars at night.<br />
Here and there in a cleft clustered contorted trees,<br />
Or the silver beard of a stream hung and swung in the breeze.<br
/>
High overhead, with a cry, the torrents leaped for the main,<br
/>
And silently sprinkled below in thin perennial rain.<br />
Dark in the staring noon, dark was Rua&rsquo;s ravine,<br />
Damp and cold was the air, and the face of the cliffs was
green.<br />
Here, in the rocky pit, accursed already of old,<br />
On a stone in the midst of a river, Rua sat and was cold.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Valley of mid-day shadows, valley of
silent falls,&rdquo;<br />
Rua sang, and his voice went hollow about the walls,<br />
&ldquo;Valley of shadow and rock, a doleful prison to me,<br />
What is the life you can give to a child of the sun and the
sea?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>And Rua arose and came to the open mouth of the glen,<br
/>
Whence he beheld the woods, and the sea, and houses of men.<br />
Wide blew the riotous trade, and smelt in his nostrils good;<br
/>
It bowed the boats on the bay, and tore and divided the wood;<br
/>
It smote and sundered the groves as Moses smote with the rod,<br
/>
And the streamers of all the trees blew like banners abroad;<br
/>
And ever and on, in a lull, the trade wind brought him along<br
/>
A far-off patter of drums and a far-off whisper of song.</p>
<p class="poetry">Swift as the swallow&rsquo;s wings, the
diligent hands on the drum<br />
Fluttered and hurried and throbbed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, woe that I
hear you come,&rdquo;<br />
Rua cried in his grief, &ldquo;a sorrowful sound to me,<br />
Mounting far and faint from the resonant shore of the sea!<br />
Woe in the song! for the grave breathes in the singers&rsquo;
breath,<br />
<a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>And I hear
in the tramp of the drums the beat of the heart of death.<br />
Home of my youth! no more, through all the length of the
years,<br />
No more to the place of the echoes of early laughter and
tears,<br />
No more shall Rua return; no more as the evening ends,<br />
To crowded eyes of welcome, to the reaching hands of
friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">All day long from the High-place the drums and
the singing came,<br />
And the even fell, and the sun went down, a wheel of flame;<br />
And night came gleaning the shadows and hushing the sounds of the
wood;<br />
And silence slept on all, where Rua sorrowed and stood.<br />
But still from the shore of the bay the sound of the festival
rang,<br />
<a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>And still
the crowd in the High-place danced and shouted and sang.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now over all the isle terror was breathed
abroad<br />
Of shadowy hands from the trees and shadowy snares in the sod;<br
/>
And before the nostrils of night, the shuddering hunter of men<br
/>
Hurried, with beard on shoulder, back to his lighted den.<br />
&ldquo;Taheia, here to my side!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Rua, my Rua,
you!&rdquo;<br />
And cold from the clutch of terror, cold with the damp of the
dew,<br />
Taheia, heavy of hair, leaped through the dark to his arms;<br />
Taheia leaped to his clasp, and was folded in from alarms.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Rua, beloved, here, see what your love
has brought;<br />
Coming&mdash;alas! returning&mdash;swift as the shuttle of
thought;<br />
Returning, alas! for to-night, with the beaten drum and the
voice,<br />
<a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>In the
shine of many torches must the sleepless clan rejoice;<br />
And Taheia the well-descended, the daughter of chief and
priest,<br />
Taheia must sit in her place in the crowded bench of the
feast.&rdquo;<br />
So it was spoken; and she, girding her garment high,<br />
Fled and was swallowed of woods, swift as the sight of an
eye.</p>
<p class="poetry">Night over isle and sea rolled her curtain of
stars,<br />
Then a trouble awoke in the air, the east was banded with
bars;<br />
Dawn as yellow as sulphur leaped on the mountain height;<br />
Dawn, in the deepest glen, fell a wonder of light;<br />
High and clear stood the palms in the eye of the brightening
east,<br />
And lo! from the sides of the sea the broken sound of the
feast!<br />
As, when in days of summer, through open windows, the fly<br />
<a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>Swift as a
breeze and loud as a trump goes by,<br />
But when frosts in the field have pinched the wintering mouse,<br
/>
Blindly noses and buzzes and hums in the firelit house:<br />
So the sound of the feast gallantly trampled at night,<br />
So it staggered and drooped, and droned in the morning light.</p>
<h3><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>IV.
THE RAID</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">It</span> chanced that as
Rua sat in the valley of silent falls,<br />
He heard a calling of doves from high on the cliffy walls.<br />
Fire had fashioned of yore, and time had broken, the rocks;<br />
There were rooting crannies for trees and nesting-places for
flocks;<br />
And he saw on the top of the cliffs, looking up from the pit of
the shade,<br />
A flicker of wings and sunshine, and trees that swung in the
trade.<br />
&ldquo;The trees swing in the trade,&rdquo; quoth Rua, doubtful
of words,<br />
&ldquo;And the sun stares from the sky, but what should trouble
the birds?&rdquo;<br />
<a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>Up from
the shade he gazed, where high the parapet shone,<br />
And he was aware of a ledge and of things that moved thereon.<br
/>
&ldquo;What manner of things are these?&nbsp; Are they spirits
abroad by day?<br />
Or the foes of my clan that are come, bringing death by a
perilous way?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">The valley was gouged like a vessel, and round
like the vessel&rsquo;s lip,<br />
With a cape of the side of the hill thrust forth like the bows of
a ship.<br />
On the top of the face of the cape a volley of sun struck
fair,<br />
And the cape overhung like a chin a gulph of sunless air.<br />
&ldquo;Silence, heart!&nbsp; What is that?&mdash;that, that
flickered and shone,<br />
Into the sun for an instant, and in an instant gone?<br />
Was it a warrior&rsquo;s plume, a warrior&rsquo;s girdle of
hair?<br />
<a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>Swung in
the loop of a rope, is he making a bridge of the air?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Once and again Rua saw, in the trenchant edge
of the sky,<br />
The giddy conjuring done.&nbsp; And then, in the blink of an
eye,<br />
A scream caught in with the breath, a whirling packet of
limbs,<br />
A lump that dived in the gulph, more swift than a dolphin
swims;<br />
And there was the lump at his feet, and eyes were alive in the
lump.<br />
Sick was the soul of Rua, ambushed close in a clump;<br />
Sick of soul he drew near, making his courage stout;<br />
And he looked in the face of the thing, and the life of the thing
went out.<br />
And he gazed on the tattooed limbs, and, behold, he knew the
man:<br />
Hoka, a chief of the Vais, the truculent foe of his clan:<br />
<a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>Hoka a
moment since that stepped in the loop of the rope,<br />
Filled with the lust of war, and alive with courage and hope.</p>
<p class="poetry">Again to the giddy cornice Rua lifted his
eyes,<br />
And again beheld men passing in the armpit of the skies.<br />
&ldquo;Foes of my race!&rdquo; cried Rua, &ldquo;the mouth of Rua
is true:<br />
Never a shark in the deep is nobler of soul than you.<br />
There was never a nobler foray, never a bolder plan;<br />
Never a dizzier path was trod by the children of man;<br />
And Rua, your evil-dealer through all the days of his years,</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Counts it honour to hate you, honour to
fall by your spears.&rdquo;<br />
And Rua straightened his back.&nbsp; &ldquo;O Vais, a scheme for
a scheme!&rdquo;<br />
Cried Rua and turned and descended the turbulent stair of the
stream,<br />
Leaping from rock to rock as the water-wagtail at home<br />
Flits through resonant valleys and skims by boulder and foam.<br
/>
<a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>And Rua
burst from the glen and leaped on the shore of the brook,<br />
And straight for the roofs of the clan his vigorous way he
took.<br />
Swift were the heels of his flight, and loud behind as he went<br
/>
Rattled the leaping stones on the line of his long descent.<br />
And ever he thought as he ran, and caught at his gasping
breath,<br />
&ldquo;O the fool of a Rua, Rua that runs to his death!<br />
But the right is the right,&rdquo; thought Rua, and ran like the
wind on the foam,<br />
&ldquo;The right is the right for ever, and home for ever
home.<br />
For what though the oven smoke?&nbsp; And what though I die ere
morn?<br />
There was I nourished and tended, and there was Taheia
born.&rdquo;<br />
Noon was high on the High-place, the second noon of the feast;<br
/>
<a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>And heat
and shameful slumber weighed on people and priest;<br />
And the heart drudged slow in bodies heavy with monstrous
meals;<br />
And the senseless limbs were scattered abroad like spokes of
wheels;<br />
And crapulous women sat and stared at the stones anigh<br />
With a bestial droop of the lip and a swinish rheum in the
eye.<br />
As about the dome of the bees in the time for the drones to
fall,<br />
The dead and the maimed are scattered, and lie, and stagger, and
crawl;<br />
So on the grades of the terrace, in the ardent eye of the day,<br
/>
The half-awake and the sleepers clustered and crawled and lay;<br
/>
And loud as the dome of the bees, in the time of a swarming
horde,<br />
A horror of many insects hung in the air and roared.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>Rua looked and wondered; he said to himself in his
heart:<br />
&ldquo;Poor are the pleasures of life, and death is the better
part.&rdquo;<br />
But lo! on the higher benches a cluster of tranquil folk<br />
Sat by themselves, nor raised their serious eyes, nor spoke:<br
/>
Women with robes unruffled and garlands duly arranged,<br />
Gazing far from the feast with faces of people estranged;<br />
And quiet amongst the quiet, and fairer than all the fair,<br />
Taheia, the well-descended, Taheia, heavy of hair.<br />
And the soul of Rua awoke, courage enlightened his eyes,<br />
And he uttered a summoning shout and called on the clan to
rise.<br />
Over against him at once, in the spotted shade of the trees,<br
/>
Owlish and blinking creatures scrambled to hands and knees;<br />
On the grades of the sacred terrace, the driveller woke to
fear,<br />
And the hand of the ham-drooped warrior brandished a wavering
spear.<br />
And Rua folded his arms, and scorn discovered his teeth;<br />
<a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>Above the
war-crowd gibbered, and Rua stood smiling beneath.<br />
Thick, like leaves in the autumn, faint, like April sleet,<br />
Missiles from tremulous hands quivered around his feet;<br />
And Taheia leaped from her place; and the priest, the
ruby-eyed,<br />
Ran to the front of the terrace, and brandished his arms, and
cried:<br />
&ldquo;Hold, O fools, he brings tidings!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hold,
&rsquo;tis the love of my heart!&rdquo;<br />
Till lo! in front of the terrace, Rua pierced with a dart.</p>
<p class="poetry">Taheia cherished his head, and the aged priest
stood by,<br />
And gazed with eyes of ruby at Rua&rsquo;s darkening eye.<br />
&ldquo;Taheia, here is the end, I die a death for a man.<br />
I have given the life of my soul to save an unsavable clan.<br />
See them, the drooping of hams! behold me the blinking crew:<br
/>
Fifty spears they cast, and one of fifty true!<br />
<a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>And you, O
priest, the foreteller, foretell for yourself if you can,<br />
Foretell the hour of the day when the Vais shall burst on your
clan!<br />
By the head of the tapu cleft, with death and fire in their
hand,<br />
Thick and silent like ants, the warriors swarm in the
land.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">And they tell that when next the sun had
climbed to the noonday skies,<br />
It shone on the smoke of feasting in the country of the Vais.</p>

TO THE FEAST OF FAMINE</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> this ballad, I have strung
together some of the more striking particularities of the
Marquesas.&nbsp; It rests upon no authority; it is in no sense,
like &ldquo;Rah&eacute;ro,&rdquo; a native story; but a patchwork
of details of manners and the impressions of a traveller.&nbsp;
It may seem strange, when the scene is laid upon these profligate
islands, to make the story hinge on love.&nbsp; But love is not
less known in the Marquesas than elsewhere; nor is there any
cause of suicide more common in the islands.</p>

&ldquo;<i>Ruby-red</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The priest&rsquo;s eyes were
probably red from the abuse of kava.&nbsp; His beard (<i>ib.</i>)
is said to be worth an estate; for the beards of old men are the
favourite head adornment of the Marquesans, as the hair of women
formed their most costly girdle.&nbsp; The former, among this
generally beardless and short-lived people, fetch to-day
considerable sums.</p>

&ldquo;<i>The sacred cabin of palm</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Which,
however, no woman could approach.&nbsp; I do not know where women
were tattooed; probably in the common house, or in the bush, for
a woman was a creature of small account.&nbsp; I must guard the
reader against supposing Taheia was at all disfigured; the art of
the Marquesan tattooer is extreme; and she would appear to be
clothed in a web of lace, inimitably delicate, exquisite in
pattern, and of a bluish hue that at once contrasts and
harmonises with the warm pigment of the native skin.&nbsp; It
would be hard to find a woman more becomingly adorned than
&ldquo;a well-tattooed&rdquo; Marquesan.</p>

&ldquo;<i>The first of the victims fell</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Without
doubt, this whole scene is untrue to fact.&nbsp; The victims were
disposed of privately and some time before.&nbsp; And indeed I am
far from claiming the credit of any high degree of accuracy for
this ballad.&nbsp; Even in a time of famine, it is probable that
Marquesan life went far more gaily than is here
represented.&nbsp; But the melancholy of to-day lies on the
writer&rsquo;s mind.</p>

<p class="poetry">But this was a man of counsel,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; To the dead man&rsquo;s brother&rsquo;s place.<br />
The east was white with the moon,<br />

THE PLACE OF THE NAME</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">There</span> fell a war in
a woody place,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lay far across the sea,<br />
A war of the march in the mirk midnight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the shot from behind the tree,<br />
The shaven head and the painted face,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The silent foot in the wood,<br />
In a land of a strange, outlandish tongue<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That was hard to be understood.</p>
<p class="poetry">It fell about the gloaming<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The general stood with his staff,<br />
<a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>He stood
and he looked east and west<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With little mind to laugh.<br />
&ldquo;Far have I been and much have I seen,<br />

But here we have woods on every hand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And a kittle water to cross.<br />
Far have I been and much have I seen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But never the beat of this;<br />
And there&rsquo;s one must go down to that waterside<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To see how deep it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">It fell in the dusk of the night<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When unco things betide,<br />
The skilly captain, the Cameron,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Went down to that waterside.<br />
Canny and soft the captain went;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And a man of the woody land,<br />
With the shaven head and the painted face,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Went down at his right hand.<br />
<a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>It fell
in the quiet night,<br />

<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Far have I been and much have I seen,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; On so perilous an employ.&rdquo;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; When unco things betide,<br />
That he was aware of a captain-man<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Drew near to the waterside.<br />
He was aware of his coming<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Down in the gloaming alone;<br />
And he looked in the face of the man<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And lo! the face was his own.<br />

This is the place of my death;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you tell me the name of the place?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Since the Frenchmen have been here<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They have called it Sault-Marie;<br />
But that is a name for priests,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And not for you and me.<br />
It went by another word,&rdquo;<br />

&ldquo;It was called Ticonderoga<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the days of the great dead.&rdquo;</p>

from the hills of heather<br />

119</span>NOTES TO TICONDEROGA</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Introduction</span>.&mdash;I first heard
this legend of my own country from that friend of men of letters,
Mr. Alfred Nutt, &ldquo;there in roaring London&rsquo;s central
stream,&rdquo; and since the ballad first saw the light of day in
<i>Scribner&rsquo;s Magazine</i>, Mr. Nutt and Lord Archibald
Campbell have been in public controversy on the facts.&nbsp; Two
clans, the Camerons and the Campbells, lay claim to this bracing
story; and they do well: the man who preferred his plighted troth
to the commands and menaces of the dead is an ancestor worth
disputing.&nbsp; But the Campbells must rest content: they have
the broad lands and the broad page of history; this appanage must
be denied them; for between the name of <i>Cameron</i> and that
of <i>Campbell</i>, the muse will never hesitate.</p>

123</span>HEATHER ALE</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">From</span> the bonny bells
of heather<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They brewed a drink long-syne,<br />
Was sweeter far than honey,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was stronger far than wine.<br />
They brewed it and they drank it,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And lay in a blessed swound<br />
For days and days together<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In their dwellings underground.</p>
<p class="poetry">There rose a king in Scotland,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A fell man to his foes,<br />
He smote the Picts in battle,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He hunted them like roes.<br />
<a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>Over
miles of the red mountain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He hunted as they fled,<br />
And strewed the dwarfish bodies<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the dying and the dead.</p>
<p class="poetry">Summer came in the country,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Red was the heather bell;<br />
But the manner of the brewing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was none alive to tell.<br />
In graves that were like children&rsquo;s<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On many a mountain head,<br />
The Brewsters of the Heather<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lay numbered with the dead.</p>
<p class="poetry">The king in the red moorland<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rode on a summer&rsquo;s day;<br />
And the bees hummed, and the curlews<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Cried beside the way.<br />
The king rode, and was angry,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Black was his brow and pale,<br />
<a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>To rule
in a land of heather<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And lack the Heather Ale.</p>
<p class="poetry">It fortuned that his vassals,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Riding free on the heath,<br />
Came on a stone that was fallen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And vermin hid beneath.<br />
Rudely plucked from their hiding,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Never a word they spoke:<br />
A son and his aged father&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Last of the dwarfish folk.</p>
<p class="poetry">The king sat high on his charger,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He looked on the little men;<br />
And the dwarfish and swarthy couple<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Looked at the king again.<br />
Down by the shore he had them;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And there on the giddy brink&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;I will give you life, ye vermin,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For the secret of the drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>There stood the son and father<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And they looked high and low;<br />
The heather was red around them,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The sea rumbled below.<br />
And up and spoke the father,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shrill was his voice to hear:<br />
&ldquo;I have a word in private,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A word for the royal ear.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Life is dear to the aged,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And honour a little thing;<br />
I would gladly sell the secret,&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Quoth the Pict to the King.<br />
His voice was small as a sparrow&rsquo;s,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And shrill and wonderful clear:<br />
&ldquo;I would gladly sell my secret,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Only my son I fear.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;For life is a little matter,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And death is nought to the young;<br />

dare not sell my honour<br />

Take <i>him</i>, O king, and bind him,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And cast him far in the deep;<br />
And it&rsquo;s I will tell the secret<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That I have sworn to keep.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">They took the son and bound him,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Neck and heels in a thong,<br />
And a lad took him and swung him,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And flung him far and strong,<br />
And the sea swallowed his body,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like that of a child of ten;&mdash;<br />
And there on the cliff stood the father,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Last of the dwarfish men.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;True was the word I told you:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Only my son I feared;<br />
For I doubt the sapling courage<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That goes without the beard.<br />
<a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>But now
in vain is the torture,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fire shall never avail:<br />
Here dies in my bosom<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The secret of Heather Ale.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>NOTE
TO HEATHER ALE</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Among</span> the curiosities of human
nature, this legend claims a high place.&nbsp; It is needless to
remind the reader that the Picts were never exterminated, and
form to this day a large proportion of the folk of Scotland:
occupying the eastern and the central parts, from the Firth of
Forth, or perhaps the Lammermoors, upon the south, to the Ord of
Caithness on the north.&nbsp; That the blundering guess of a dull
chronicler should have inspired men with imaginary loathing for
their own ancestors is already strange: that it should have
begotten this wild legend seems incredible.&nbsp; Is it possible
the chronicler&rsquo;s error was merely nominal? that what he
told, and what the people proved themselves so ready to receive,
about the Picts, was true or partly true of some anterior and
perhaps Lappish savages, small of stature, black of hue, dwelling
underground&mdash;possibly also the distillers of some forgotten
spirit?&nbsp; See Mr. Campbell&rsquo;s <i>Tales of the West
Highlands</i>.</p>

133</span>CHRISTMAS AT SEA</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">The</span> sheets were
frozen hard, and they cut the naked hand;<br />
The decks were like a slide, where a seaman scarce could
stand;<br />
The wind was a nor&rsquo;wester, blowing squally off the sea;<br
/>
And cliffs and spouting breakers were the only things a-lee.</p>
<p class="poetry">They heard the surf a-roaring before the break
of day;<br />
But &rsquo;twas only with the peep of light we saw how ill we
lay.<br />
We tumbled every hand on deck instanter, with a shout,<br />
And we gave her the maintops&rsquo;l, and stood by to go
about.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>All day we tacked and tacked between the South Head and
the North;<br />
All day we hauled the frozen sheets, and got no further forth;<br
/>
All day as cold as charity, in bitter pain and dread,<br />
For very life and nature we tacked from head to head.</p>
<p class="poetry">We gave the South a wider berth, for there the
tide-race roared;<br />
But every tack we made we brought the North Head close aboard:<br
/>
So&rsquo;s we saw the cliffs and houses, and the breakers running
high,<br />
And the coastguard in his garden, with his glass against his
eye.</p>
<p class="poetry">The frost was on the village roofs as white as
ocean foam;<br />
The good red fires were burning bright in every &rsquo;longshore
home;<br />
<a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>The
windows sparkled clear, and the chimneys volleyed out;<br />
And I vow we sniffed the victuals as the vessel went about.</p>
<p class="poetry">The bells upon the church were rung with a
mighty jovial cheer;<br />
For it&rsquo;s just that I should tell you how (of all days in
the year)<br />
This day of our adversity was bless&egrave;d Christmas morn,<br
/>
And the house above the coastguard&rsquo;s was the house where I
was born.</p>
<p class="poetry">O well I saw the pleasant room, the pleasant
faces there,<br />
My mother&rsquo;s silver spectacles, my father&rsquo;s silver
hair;<br />
And well I saw the firelight, like a flight of homely elves,<br
/>
Go dancing round the china-plates that stand upon the
shelves.</p>
<p class="poetry">And well I knew the talk they had, the talk
that was of me,<br />
Of the shadow on the household and the son that went to sea;<br
/>
<a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>And O
the wicked fool I seemed, in every kind of way,<br />
To be here and hauling frozen ropes on bless&egrave;d Christmas
Day.</p>
<p class="poetry">They lit the high sea-light, and the dark began
to fall.<br />
&ldquo;All hands to loose topgallant sails,&rdquo; I heard the
captain call.<br />
&ldquo;By the Lord, she&rsquo;ll never stand it,&rdquo; our first
mate, Jackson, cried.<br />
. . . &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the one way or the other, Mr.
Jackson,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p class="poetry">She staggered to her bearings, but the sails
were new and good,<br />
And the ship smelt up to windward just as though she
understood.<br />
As the winter&rsquo;s day was ending, in the entry of the
night,<br />
We cleared the weary headland, and passed below the light.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>And they heaved a mighty breath, every soul on board
but me,<br />
As they saw her nose again pointing handsome out to sea;<br />
But all that I could think of, in the darkness and the cold,<br

Was just that I was leaving home and my folks were growing
old.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

copied or distributed:

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
